            <section xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:ezxhtml="http://ez.no/xmlns/ezpublish/docbook/xhtml" xmlns:ezcustom="http://ez.no/xmlns/ezpublish/docbook/custom" version="5.0-variant ezpublish-1.0">
              <para>Mexican cuisine is primarily a fusion of indigenous Mesoamerican cooking with European, especially Spanish. The basic staples are native foods such as corn, beans and chili peppers.</para>
              <title ezxhtml:level="2">Main Features</title>
              <para>The basic staples are native foods such as corn, beans and chili peppers. Europeans introduced a large number of other foods, the most important of which were meats from domesticated animals (beef, pork, chicken, goat and sheep), dairy products (especially cheese) and various herbs and spices. While the Spanish initially tried to impose their own diet on the country, this was not possible and eventually the foods and cooking techniques began to be mixed, especially in colonial era convents. African and Asian influences were also introduced into the mixture during this era as a result of African slavery in New Spain and the Manila-Acapulco Galleons.</para>
              <title ezxhtml:level="2">History</title>
              <para>Over the centuries this resulted in regional cuisines, based on local conditions such as those in Oaxaca, Veracruz and the Yucatán Peninsula. Mexican cuisine is an important aspect of the culture, social structure and popular traditions of Mexico. For this reason and others, Mexican cuisine was inscribed in 2010 on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO.</para>
              <para>Mexican cuisine is as complex as any of the great cuisines in the world. It is created mostly with ingredients native to Mexico as well as those brought over by the Spanish conquistadors, with some new influences since then. In addition to staples such as corn and chile peppers, native ingredients include tomatoes, squashes, avocados, cocoa and vanilla, as well as ingredients not generally used in other cuisines such as edible flowers, vegetables such as huauzontle and papaloquelite or small criollo avocados, whose skin is edible.</para>
              <title ezxhtml:level="2">Food and festivals</title>
              <para>Mexican cuisine is elaborate and often tied to symbolism and festivals, one reason it was named as an example of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO. Many of the foods of Mexico are complicated because of their relation to the social structure of the country. Food preparation, especially for family and social events, is considered to be an investment in order to maintain social relationships. Even the idea of flavor is considered to be social, with meals prepared for certain dinners and certain occasions when they are considered the most tasty.</para>
              <ezembed xlink:href="ezcontent://[reference:ref_content_image__media__images__tastes__mexican_cuisine__guacomole]" view="embed" ezxhtml:class="ez-embed-type-image" ezxhtml:align="right">

              </ezembed>
              <para>The ability to cook well, called "sazón" (lit. seasoning) is considered to be a gift generally gained from experience and a sense of commitment to the diners. For the Day of the Dead festival, foods such as tamales and mole are set out on altars and it is believed that the visiting dead relatives eat the essence of the food. If eaten afterwards by the living it is considered to be tasteless. In central Mexico, the main festival foods are mole, barbacoa, carnitas and mixiotes. They are often prepared to feed around five hundred guests, requiring groups of cooks. The cooking is part of the social custom meant to bind families and communities.</para>
              <ezembed xlink:href="ezcontent://[reference:ref_content_image__media__images__tastes__mexican_cuisine__enchilada_mole]" view="embed" ezxhtml:class="ez-embed-type-image" ezxhtml:align="left">

              </ezembed>
              <para>Mexican regional home cooking is completely different from the food served in most Mexican restaurants outside Mexico, which is usually some variety of Tex-Mex. Some of Mexico’s traditional foods involved complex or long cooking processes. Before industrialization, traditional women spent several hours a day boiling dried corn then grinding them on a metate to make the dough for tortillas, cooking them one-by-one on a comal griddle. In some areas, tortillas are still made this way. Sauces and salsas were also ground in a mortar called a molcajete. Today, blenders are more often used, though the texture is a bit different. Most people in Mexico would say that those made with a molcajete taste better, but few can do this now.</para>
              <title ezxhtml:level="2">Street food</title>
              <ezembed xlink:href="ezcontent://[reference:ref_content_image__media__images__tastes__mexican_cuisine__mexican_street_food]" view="embed" ezxhtml:class="ez-embed-type-image" ezxhtml:align="right">

              </ezembed>
              <para>Mexican street food is one of the most varied parts of the cuisine. It can include tacos, quesadillas, pambazos, tamales, huaraches, alambres, al pastor, and food not suitable to cook at home, including barbacoa, carnitas, and since many homes in Mexico do not have or make use of ovens, roasted chicken. One attraction of street food in Mexico is the satisfaction of hunger or craving without all the social and emotional connotation of eating at home, although longtime customers can have something of a friendship/familial relationship with a chosen vendor.</para>

              <para>Ethiopian cuisine characteristically consists of vegetable and often very spicy meat dishes. This is usually in the form of wat, a thick stew, served atop injera, a large sourdough flatbread, which is about 50 centimeters (20 inches) in diameter and made out of fermented teff flour.</para>
              <title ezxhtml:level="2">Main Features</title>
              <para>Ethiopians eat exclusively with their right hands, using pieces of injera to pick up bites of entrées and side dishes. Utensils are optional. A typical dish consists of injera accompanied by a spicy stew, which frequently includes beef, lamb, vegetables and various types of legumes, such as lentils. Gurage cuisine also makes use of the false banana plant, a type of ensete. The plant is pulverized and fermented to make a bread-like food called qocho or kocho, which is eaten with kitfo.</para>
              <title ezxhtml:level="2">History</title>
              <para>The Ethiopian Orthodox Church prescribes a number of fasting (tsom) periods, including Wednesdays, Fridays, and the entire Lenten season, so Ethiopian cuisine contains many dishes that are vegan. Pasta is frequently available throughout Ethiopia, including rural areas. Coffee is also a large part of Ethiopian culture and cuisine. After every meal, a coffee ceremony is enacted and espresso coffee is served.</para>
              <ezembed xlink:href="ezcontent://[reference:ref_content_image__media__images__tastes__ethiopian_cuisine__ethiopian_kitfo]" view="embed" ezxhtml:class="ez-embed-type-image" ezxhtml:align="left">

              <para>In their adherence to strict fasting, Ethiopian cooks have developed a rich array of cooking oil sources—besides sesame and safflower—for use as a substitute for animal fats which is forbidden during fasting periods. Ethiopian cuisine also uses nug (also spelled noog, also known as "niger seed”).</para>
              <title ezxhtml:level="3">Coffee</title>
              <para>According to some sources, drinking of coffee (buna) is likely to have originated in Ethiopia. A key national beverage, it is an important part of local commerce.</para>
              <ezembed xlink:href="ezcontent://[reference:ref_content_image__media__images__tastes__ethiopian_cuisine__coffee_ceremony]" view="embed" ezxhtml:class="ez-embed-type-image" ezxhtml:align="right">

              </ezembed>
              <para>The coffee ceremony is the traditional serving of coffee, usually after a big meal. It often involves the use of a jebena, a clay coffee pot in which the coffee is boiled. The preparer roasts the coffee beans right in front of guests, then walks around wafting the smoke throughout the room so participants may sample the scent of coffee. Then the preparer grinds the coffee beans in a traditional tool called a mokecha. The coffee is put into the jebena, boiled with water, and then served with small cups. Coffee is usually served with sugar, but is also served with salt in many parts of Ethiopia. In some parts of the country, niter kibbeh is added instead of sugar or salt.</para>
              <para>Snacks, such as popcorn or toasted barley (or kollo), are often served with the coffee. In most homes, a dedicated coffee area is surrounded by fresh grass, with special furniture for the coffee maker. A complete ceremony has three rounds of coffee (Abol, Tona and Bereka) and is accompanied by the burning of frankincense.</para>
              <title ezxhtml:level="3">Spirits</title>
              <para>Tej is a potent honey wine. It is similar to mead, which is frequently served in bars (in particular, in a tej bet or "tej house"). Katikala and araqe are inexpensive local spirits that are very strong.</para>
              <para>Tella is a home-brewed beer served in tella bet ("tella houses") which specialize in serving tella only. Tella is the most common beverage made and served in households during holidays.</para>

              <para>Thai cuisine is the national cuisine of Thailand. Balance, detail and variety are of paramount significance to Thai chefs. In his book The Principles of Thai Cookery, celebrity chef, writer and authority on Thai cuisine McDang wrote: "What is Thai food? Every country in the world has its own food profile. It reflects its culture, environment, ingenuity and values. In the case of Thailand, these words come to mind: intricacy; attention to detail; texture; color; taste; and the use of ingredients with medicinal benefits, as well as good flavor.</para>

              <para>Thai cuisine is one of the most popular cuisine in the world. In 2011, seven of Thai's popular dishes make it to the list of 'World's 50 Most Delicious Foods (Readers' Pick)' — a worldwide online poll by 35,000 people held by CNN International. This made Thai as the cooking tradition with most dish that successfully made it to the list.</para>
              <para>Thai cuisine and the culinary traditions and cuisines of Thailand's neighbors have mutually influenced one another over the course of many centuries. Regional variations tend to correlate to neighboring states (often sharing the same cultural background and ethnicity on both sides of the border) as well as climate and geography. Many dishes that are now popular in Thailand were originally Chinese dishes. They were introduced to Thailand by the Hokkien people starting in the 15th century, and by the Teochew people who started settling in larger numbers from the late 18th century CE onward, mainly in the towns and cities, and now form the majority of the Thai Chinese.</para>

              <para>Important to Thai dining is the practice of khluk, mixing the flavors and textures of different dishes with the rice from one's plate. The food is pushed by the fork, held in the left hand, into the spoon held in the right hand, which is then brought to the mouth. A traditional ceramic spoon is sometimes used for soup, and knives are not generally used at the table.</para>
              <para>Thai meals typically consist of rice (khao in Thai) with many complementary dishes shared by all. The dishes are all served at the same time, including the soups, and it is also customary to provide more dishes than there are guests at a table. A Thai family meal would normally consist of rice with several dishes which should form a harmonious contrast of flavors and textures as well as preparation methods. Traditionally, a meal would have at least five elements: a dip or relish for raw or cooked vegetables (khrueang chim) is the most crucial component of any Thai meal. Khrueang chim, considered a building block of Thai food by Chef McDang, may come in the form of a spicy chili sauce or relish called nam phrik (made of raw or cooked chilies and other ingredients, which are then mashed together), or a type of dip enriched with coconut milk called lon. The other elements would include a clear soup (perhaps a spicy tom yam or a mellow tom chuet), a curry or stew (essentially any dish identified with the kaeng prefix), a deep-fried dish and a stir fried dish of meat, fish, seafood, or vegetables.</para>

              <para>Thai food is known for its enthusiastic use of fresh (rather than dried) herbs and spices. Common flavors in Thai food come from garlic, galangal, coriander/cilantro, lemon grass, shallots, pepper, kaffir lime leaves, shrimp paste, fish sauce, and chilies. Palm sugar, made from the sap of certain Borassus palms, is used to sweeten dishes while lime and tamarind contribute sour notes. Meats used in Thai cuisine are usually pork and chicken, and also duck, beef, and water buffalo. Goat and mutton are rarely eaten except by Muslim Thais.</para>

              <para>Israeli cuisine comprises local dishes by people native to Israel and dishes brought to Israel by Jews from the Diaspora. Israeli cuisine has adopted, and continues to adapt, elements of various styles of Jewish cuisine, particularly the Mizrahi, Sephardic and Ashkenazi styles of cooking. It incorporates many foods traditionally eaten in Levantine, Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisines, and foods such as falafel, hummus, msabbha, shakshouka, couscous, and za'atar are now widely popular in Israel</para>
              <title ezxhtml:level="2">Main Features</title>
              <para>Other influences on the cuisine are the availability of foods common to the Mediterranean region, especially certain kinds of fruits and vegetables, dairy products and fish; the distinctive traditional dishes prepared at holiday times; the tradition of keeping kosher; and food customs specific to Shabbat and different Jewish holidays.</para>
              <title ezxhtml:level="2">History</title>
              <para>Israel’s culinary traditions comprise foods and cooking methods that span three thousand years of history. Over that time, these traditions have been shaped by influences from Asia, Africa and Europe, and religious and ethnic influences have resulted in a culinary melting pot. Biblical and archaeological records provide insight into the culinary life of the region as far back as 968 BCE.</para>

              </ezembed>
              <para>The food of the ancient Israelites was based on several products that still play important roles in modern Israeli cuisine. These were known as the seven species: olives, figs, dates, pomegranates, wheat, barley and grapes. The diet, based on locally grown produce, was enhanced by imported spices, readily available due to the country’s position at the crossroads of east-west trade routes.</para>
              <title ezxhtml:level="2">Street Foods:</title>
              <para>In Israel, as in many other Middle Eastern countries, "street food" is a kind of fast food that is sometimes literally eaten while standing in the street, while in some cases there are places to sit down. The following are some foods that are usually eaten in this way:</para>
              <title ezxhtml:level="3">Falafel</title>
              <para>Falafel are fried balls or patties of spiced, mashed chickpeas or fava beans and are a common Middle Eastern street food that have become identified with Israeli cuisine. Falafel is most often served in a pita, with pickles, tahina, hummus, cut vegetable salad and often, harif, a hot sauce, the type used depending on the origin of the falafel maker.</para>
              <title ezxhtml:level="3">Shawarma</title>
              <ezembed xlink:href="ezcontent://[reference:ref_content_image__media__images__tastes__israeli_cuisine__shawarma]" view="embed" ezxhtml:class="ez-embed-type-image" ezxhtml:align="right">

              </ezembed>
              <para>Shawarma, (from çevirme, meaning "rotating" in Turkish) is usually made in Israel with turkey, with lamb fat added. The shawarma meat is sliced and marinated and then roasted on a huge rotating skewer. The cooked meat is shaved off and stuffed into a pita, plainly with hummus and tahina, or with additional trimmings such as fresh or fried onion rings, French fries, salads and pickles.</para>
              <title ezxhtml:level="3">Shakshouka</title>
              <ezembed xlink:href="ezcontent://[reference:ref_content_image__media__images__tastes__israeli_cuisine__shakshuka]" view="embed" ezxhtml:class="ez-embed-type-image" ezxhtml:align="left">

              </ezembed>
              <para>Shakshouka, originally a workman’s breakfast popularized by North African Jews in Israel, is made simply of fried eggs in spicy tomato sauce, with other vegetable ingredients or sausage optional. Shakshouka is typically served in the same frying pan in which it is cooked, with thick slices of white bread to mop up the sauce, and a side of salad.</para>
              <title ezxhtml:level="2">Places to eat</title>
              <para>There are thousands of restaurants, casual eateries, cafés and bars in Israel, offering a wide array of choices in food and culinary styles.</para>
              <title ezxhtml:level="3">Falafel stands or kiosks</title>
              <para>Falafel stands or kiosks are common in every neighborhood. Falafel vendors compete to stand apart from their competitors and this leads to the offering of additional special extras like chips, deep fried eggplant, salads and pickles for the price of a single portion of falafel.</para>
              <title ezxhtml:level="3">Hummusia</title>
              <para>Hummusia is an establishment that offers mainly hummus with a limited selection of extras such as tahina, hardboiled egg, falafel, onion, pickles, lemon and garlic sauce and pita or taboon bread.</para>
              <title ezxhtml:level="3">Misada Mizrahit</title>
              <para>Misada Mizrahit (literally "Eastern restaurant") refers to Mizrahi Jewish, middle eastern or Arabic restaurants. These popular and relatively inexpensive establishments often offer a selection of meze salads followed by grilled meat with a side of french fries and a simple dessert such as chocolate mousse for dessert.</para>
              <title ezxhtml:level="3">Steakiyot</title>
              <para>Steakiyot are meat grills selling sit down and take away chicken, turkey or lamb as steak, shishlik, kebab and even Jerusalem mixed grill, all in pita or in taboon bread.</para>

              <para>Jamaican cuisine includes a mixture of cooking techniques, flavours, spices and influences from the indigenous people on the island of Jamaica, and the Spanish, British, Africans, Indian and Chinese who have inhabited the island. It is also influenced by the crops introduced into the island from tropical Southeast Asia.</para>
              <title ezxhtml:level="2">Main Features</title>
              <para>Jamaican cuisine includes various dishes from the different cultures brought to the island with the arrival of people from elsewhere. Other dishes are novel or a fusion of techniques and traditions. In addition to ingredients that are native to Jamaica, many foods have been introduced and are now grown locally. A wide variety of seafood, tropical fruits and meats are available.</para>

              <para>Some Jamaican cuisine dishes are variations on the cuisines and cooking styles brought to the island from elsewhere. These are often modified to incorporate local produce. Others are novel and have developed locally. Popular Jamaican dishes include curry goat, fried dumplings, ackee and saltfish (cod) – the national dish of Jamaica – fried plantain, "jerk", steamed cabbage and "rice and peas" (pigeon peas or kidney beans). Jamaican cuisine has been adapted by African, Indian, British, French, Spanish, Chinese influences. Jamaican patties and various pastries and breads are also popular as well as fruit beverages and Jamaican rum.</para>
              <title ezxhtml:level="2">History</title>
              <para>The Spanish, the first European arrivals to the island contributed dishes such as the vinegary concoction escovitched fish (Spanish escabeche) contributed by Spanish Jews. Later, Cantonese/Hakka influences developed the Jamaican patty, an empanada styled turnover filled with spiced meat. African cuisine developed on the island as a result of waves of slavery introduced by the European powers. More Chinese and East Indian influences can also be found in Jamaican cuisine, as a result of indentured laborers who replaced slaves after emancipation brought their own culinary talents (especially curry, which Jamaican chefs sometimes use to season goat meat for special occasions).</para>

              <para>African, Indian, American, Chinese and British cuisines are not new to the island. Through many years of British colonialism, the cuisine developed many habits of cooking particular to a trading colony.</para>
              <para>The Jamaican cuisine is quite diverse and mention must be made of the Rastafarian influence. Rastafarians have a vegetarian approach to preparing food, cooking, and eating, and have introduced a host of unique vegetarian dishes to the Jamaican cuisine. They do not eat pork, and the strict ones do not eat meat, including poultry and fish. There are even some who believe in cooking with little or no salt and cooking in an 'Ital' way.</para>

              <title ezxhtml:level="3">Ackee and saltfish</title>

              <para>Ackee and saltfish is a traditional Jamaican dish. To prepare the dish, salt cod (salt fish should be soaked overnight to eliminate most of the salt) is sautéed with boiled ackee (The ackee fruit was imported to The Caribbean from Ghana before 1725), onions, Scotch Bonnet peppers (optional), tomatoes, and spices, such as black pepper and pimiento. It can be garnished with bacon and tomatoes, and is usually served as breakfast or dinner alongside breadfruit, hard dough bread, dumplings, fried plantain, or boiled green bananas.</para>
              <para>Ackee and saltfish can also be eaten with rice and peas or plain white rice. When seasonings (onion, escallion, thyme, garlic) and saltfish are combined with plain rice it is often called seasoned rice which is a one pot meal that is usually eaten on Fridays as an inexpensive meal for dinner.</para>
              <title ezxhtml:level="3">Brown stew chicken</title>
              <para>Brown stew chicken, also referred to as stew chicken, is a dish typically eaten for dinner throughout the English speaking Caribbean islands. The dish is popular in Jamaica, Antigua, Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, Saint Lucia, Grenada, Dominica and in Caribbean communities throughout the world. The dish is called brown because of the distinct dark color of the dish. The color is achieved by browning the chicken in brown sugar, which creates a rich gravy to which main vegetable components like onions, garlic and carrots are added.</para>
              <title ezxhtml:level="3">Curry goat</title>
              <para>Curry goat is a curry dish originating in South Asia and has become very popular in Indo-Caribbean cuisine. This dish has spread throughout the English speaking Caribbean and also the Caribbean diaspora in North America and Great Britain.</para>
              <para>Curry goat is a popular party dish in Jamaica, and at a 'big dance' a local expert or 'specialist' is often brought in to cook it. It is considerably more mild than the equivalent dishes from the Indian subcontinent and is flavored with a spice mix that is typical of Indo-Jamaican cooking and Scotch Bonnet Peppers; it is almost always served with rice and, in restaurants in North America and Great Britain, other typically Caribbean side dishes such as fried plantain may be served as an accompaniment.</para>

              <para>It is rich in meat, especially pork, chicken and beef (depending on the region), winter vegetables (cabbage in the dish bigos), and herbs. It is also characteristic in its use of various kinds of noodles the most notable of which are kluski as well as cereals such as kasha (from the Polish word kasza). Generally speaking, Polish cuisine is hearty and uses a lot of cream and eggs. The traditional dishes are often demanding in preparation. Many Poles allow themselves a generous amount of time to serve and enjoy their festive meals, especially Christmas eve dinner (Wigilia) or Easter breakfast which could take a number of days to prepare in their entirety.</para>

              <para>The Polish national dishes are bigos; pierogi; kiełbasa; kotlet schabowy (type of breaded cutlet); gołąbki (type of cabbage roll); zrazy (type of roulade); roast pieczeń; sour cucumber soup Polish: zupa ogórkowa; mushroom soup, Polish: zupa grzybowa (quite different from the North American cream of mushroom); tomato soup (Polish: zupa pomidorowa); rosół [ˈrɔɕuw] (variety of meat broth); żurek (sour rye soup); flaki (variety of tripe soup); and barszcz among others.</para>
              <title ezxhtml:level="2">History</title>
              <para>Polish cuisine in the Middle Ages was based on dishes made of agricultural produce and cereal crops (millet, rye, wheat), meats of wild and farm animals, fruits, forest berries and game, honey, herbs and local spices. It was known above all for abundant use of salt from Wieliczka and permanent presence of groats (kasza). During the Middle Ages the cuisine of Poland was heavy and spicy. Two main ingredients were meat (both game and beef) and cereal. Apart from cereals, a large portion of the daily diet of mediaeval Poles consisted of beans, mostly broad beans and peas. Among the delicacies of the Polish nobility were honey-braised bear paws served with horseradish-flavoured salad (now species protected in Poland), smoked bear tongue and bear bacon.</para>
              <para>In the Renaissance period many Italian cooks came to Poland after 1518 along with the Italian queen Bona Sforza (second wife of Sigismund I of Poland). Although native vegetable foods were an ancient and intrinsic part of the cuisine, this began a period in which vegetables like lettuce, leeks, celeriac and cabbage were more widely used. While her southern cooks may have helped elevate and expand the role of various vegetables in royal Polish cuisine, records show that the court of King Jagiello enjoyed a variety of vegetables including lettuce, beets, cabbage, turnip, carrots, peas and cauliflower.</para>
              <para>Polish-style pickled cucumber (ogórek kiszony) is a variety developed in the northern Europe. It has been exported worldwide and is found in the cuisines of many countries. It is sour but tends to be seasoned differently. It is usually preserved in wooden barrels. A cucumber only pickled for a few days is different in taste (less sour) than one pickled for a longer time and is called ogórek małosolny, which means "lightly salted cucumber". Another kind of pickled cucumber, popular in Poland, is ogórek konserwowy (preserved cucumber) which is rather sweet and vinegary in taste, due to different composition of the preserving solution and the fact that it's not fermented, just preserved. It is kept in wooden barrels.</para>
              <para>With the subsequent decline of Poland, and the grain production crisis that followed The Deluge, potatoes began to replace the traditional use of cereal. The oldest surviving Polish cook-book, Compendium Ferculorum albo zebranie potraw ("Collection of Dishes") by Stanisław Czerniecki was published in Kraków in 1682. Under the partitions, the cuisine of Poland became heavily influenced by cuisines of the surrounding empires. This included Russian and German cuisines, but also the culinary traditions of most nations of the Austro-Hungarian empire. The 19th century also saw the creation of many Polish cookbooks, by Jan Szyttler, Anna Ciundziewicka, Wincenta Zawadzka, Lucyna Ćwierczakiewiczowa and others.</para>
              <para>Post World War II, most enduring of Polish culinary traditions are the pierogi, a national dish of Poland, originating in the ancient culinary traditions of the former Polish eastern territories (Kresy).</para>

              <para>After the end of World War II, Poland fell under Soviet / Communist occupation. Some restaurants were nationalized. The communists envisioned a net of lunch rooms called "bufet" for the workers at various companies, and milk bars for the public. The majority of restaurants that survived the 1940s and 1950s were state-owned. Workplace lunch rooms promoted mostly inexpensive meals, including soups of all kinds, meatballs and pork chops, and staples such as placki ziemniaczane (potato pancakes), placki z jablkami (apple pancakes), kopytka (potato gnocchi), leniwe (farmer's cheese gnocchi served sweet) and pierogi. A typical second course consisted of meat cutlet served with potatoes or buckwheat and "surówka" (raw, julienned vegetables). The popular Polish kotlet schabowy is a breaded cutlet similar to the Austrian Wiener schnitzel and the Italian and Spanish Milanesa.</para>
              <para>Among the popular dishes introduced by the public restaurants was "kotlet mielony" meatball, a sort of a hamburger often served with beet puree and fresh carrots. The traditional recipes were mostly preserved during the Wigilia feast (Christmas Eve), for which many families tried to prepare 12 traditional courses.</para>

              <para>Traditional Christmas Eve supper called Wigilia is meatless, usually consists of barszcz (borscht) with uszka (small dumplings) – a classic Polish Christmas Eve starter, followed by fried carp, carp fillet or cod with apple &amp; leeks fresh salad, carp in aspic etc. traditionally carp (fried or Jewish style) provides a main component of the Christmas Eve meal across Poland. Other popular dishes, for the next day, include pickled matjas herring, rollmops, pierogi with sauerkraut and forest mushrooms, fish soup, kiełbasa, hams and bigos (savory stew of cabbage and meat) and vegetable salads. Among popular desserts are gingerbread, cheesecake, various fruits like oranges among others, poppy seed cake makowiec (makówki in Silesia), fruit kompot, kluski with poppyseed, kutia sweet grain pudding in the eastern regions, like (Białystok) and ginger bread. Regional dishes include żurek, siemieniotka (in Silesia), and kołduny - mushrooms or meat stuffed dumplings in the eastern regions.</para>

              <para>Tłusty Czwartek (Fat Thursday) is a Catholic feast celebrated on the last Thursday before Lent, which is also the last day of carnival. Traditionally it is an occasion to enjoy fair amounts of sweets and cakes which afterwards are not allowed by the Church until Easter. Tłusty Czwartek belongs to movable feasts, as it is connected with the date of Easter and beginning of the Lent. The next Thursday falls already after Ash Wednesday that is the period of the Lent when the Catholics should refrain from overeating.</para>
              <para>The most popular sweets during Fat Thursday are pączki (Polish donuts) or faworki called also in some regions of Poland "chrust". The traditional donuts are filled with rose petal jam (plum jam or apple) and covered with thin layer of icing or powdered sugar, sprinkled with orange peel. Fat Thursday used to mark the beginning of a Fat Week, the period of great gluttony during which Polish ancestors consumed dishes served with smalec (lard), bacon and all kinds of meat.</para>
              <title ezxhtml:level="2">Easter breakfast</title>
              <para>A typical Easter breakfast often consists of cold-cuts served with horseradish sauce and beet salads, breads, bigos, żurek, kiełbasa, smoked salmon or herring, marinated vegetable salads, Easter salad (chopped boiled eggs, green peas, cwikła, carrot, apple, potato, parsley and mayonnaise) coffee, tea and cakes, i.e. chocolate cake, makowiec, mazurek, sernik, etc.</para>

              <para>Norwegian cuisine in its traditional form is based largely on the raw materials readily available in Norway and its mountains, wilderness and coast. It differs in many respects from its continental counterparts with a stronger focus on game and fish. Many of the traditional dishes are results of using conserved materials, with respect to the long winters.</para>
              <title ezxhtml:level="2">Main dish</title>
              <para>The one traditional Norwegian dish with a claim to international popularity is smoked salmon. It is now a major export, and could be considered the most important Scandinavian contribution to modern international cuisine. Smoked salmon exists traditionally in many varieties, and is often served with scrambled eggs, dill, sandwiches and mustard sauce. Another traditional salmon product is gravlaks, (literally "buried salmon"). Traditionally, gravlaks would be cured for 24 hours in a mix of sugar and salt and herbs (dill).</para>

              <para>The largest Norwegian food export (in fact the main Norwegian export of any kind for most of the country's history) in the past has been stockfish ("tørrfisk" in Norwegian). The Atlantic cod variety known as 'skrei' because of its migrating habits, has been a source of wealth for millennia, fished annually in what is known as the 'Lofotfiske' after the island chain of 'Lofoten'. Stockfish has been a staple food internationally for centuries, in particular on the Iberian peninsula and the African coast. Both during the age of sail and in the industrial age, stockfish played a part in world history as an enabling food for cross-Atlantic trade and the slave trade triangle.</para>
              <ezembed xlink:href="ezcontent://[reference:ref_content_image__media__images__tastes__norwegian_cuisine__beef_stew]" view="embed" ezxhtml:class="ez-embed-type-image" ezxhtml:align="left">

              </ezembed>
              <para>Norway is one of the few places outside Asia where sweet and sour flavoring is used extensively. A more peculiar Norwegian fish dish is Rakfisk, which consists of fermented trout, a culinary relation of Swedish surströmming. Until the 20th century, shellfish was not eaten to any extent. This was partly due to the abundance of fish and the relative high expenditure of time involved in catching shellfish when set against its nutritional value, as well as the fact that such food spoils rather quickly, even in a northern climate. However, prawns, crabs and mussels have become quite popular, especially during summer.</para>
              <title ezxhtml:level="2">Fruits and desserts</title>
              <para>Fruits and berries mature slowly in the cold climate. This makes for a tendency to smaller volume with a more intense taste. Strawberries, bilberries, lingonberries, raspberries and apples are popular and are part of a variety of desserts, and cherries in the parts of the country where those are grown. The wild growing cloudberry is regarded as a delicacy. A typical Norwegian dessert on special occasions is cloudberries with whipped or plain cream. Strawberry-Apple pie is also popular because of its rich flavour of strawberries and apples. Rhubarb pie (rabarbra pai in Norwegian) is another favoured dish in Norway.</para>
              <ezembed xlink:href="ezcontent://[reference:ref_content_image__media__images__tastes__norwegian_cuisine__kromkaker_og_sandkaker]" view="embed" ezxhtml:class="ez-embed-type-image" ezxhtml:align="right">

              <para>German and Nordic-style cakes and pastries, such as sponge cakes and Danish pastry (known as "wienerbrød", literal translation: "Viennese bread") share the table with a variety of homemade cakes, waffles and biscuits. Cardamom is a common flavouring. Another Norwegian cake is Krumkake, a paper- thin rolled cake filled with whipped cream. (Krumkake means 'Curved Cake' or 'Crooked Cake'). Baked meringues are known as "pikekyss", literally translated as "girl's kiss".</para>
              <para>During Christmas (jul), the traditional Norwegian Holiday season, many different dessert dishes are served including Julekake, a heavily spiced leavened loaf often coated with sugar and cinnamon, and Multekrem (whipped cream with cloudberries).</para>
              <title ezxhtml:level="2">Coffee</title>
              <para>Norway has a particularly strong affinity for coffee and is the second highest consumer of coffee in the world, with the average Norwegian drinking 142 liters, or 9.5 kg of coffee in 2011. Coffee plays a large role in Norwegian culture; it is common to invite people over for coffee and cakes and to enjoy cups of coffee with dessert after the main courses in get-togethers. The traditional way of serving coffee in Norway is plain black, usually in a mug, rather than a cup. As in the rest of the west, recent years have seen a shift from coffee made by boiling ground beans to Italian-style coffee bars, tended by professional baristas. Coffee is included in one of the most traditional alcoholic beverages in Norway, commonly known as karsk, from Trøndelag.</para>

              <para>The number of possible work places in New York is truly astounding. There are a lot of places within walking distance of the Tasteful Planet on Bedford Avenue, in Williamsburg Brooklyn.</para>
              <para>Cafes are obviously a great place to get work done as you get surrounded by creative people and stimulating beverages, coffee and tea. And in Brooklyn, folks take their cafes seriously. It’s not at all unusual to see some well-dressed people slumping over their Macbooks (and occasional Dell) technically, they’re on the clock.</para>
              <para>By collective agreement, our office’s favorite café is City of Saints three blocks away on Meserole. Further south on Bogart street you have Swallow Café on Bogart street, which has a lot of seating available and because it doesn’t close until 9pm on the weekdays, is welcoming to the late night worker.</para>
              <para>Other great ones include Gimme Coffee! On Powers Street and Variety on Graham Avenue and Conselyea Street. Both have superb espresso drinks and plain old coffee, super nice baristas, and plenty of seating.</para>
              <para>If you want to be closer to the water and see the spectacular skyline of Manhattan, visit Blue Bottle Coffee on Barry Street and Bedford Avenue. This is the first New York location of the Oakland-based roastery. It’s gargantuan— 2,100 square feet of espresso goodness. And if that coffee playground doesn’t impress you, check out Devoción on 69 Grand St. This Colombian-based coffee joint Fed-Exs coffee from Columbia the night before, often 10 days after being picked. It should delight coffee snobs from around the world.</para>
              <para>While there are thousands of places to get work done, the best one may be (not so surprisingly) home.</para>

              <para>There are multiple options when blasting off a journalistic adventure like ours. We think you’d like to know what are the options when publishing about travels and cuisines. Here are the options we most liked:</para>
              <para>A guide book or travel guide is "a book of information about a place, designed for the use of visitors or tourists". An early example is Thomas West's, guide to the Lake District published in 1778. Thomas West, an English clergyman, popularized the idea of walking for pleasure in his guide to the Lake District of 1778. In the introduction he wrote that he aimed:</para>
              <para>“to encourage the taste of visiting the lakes by furnishing the traveller with a Guide; and for that purpose, the writer has here collected and laid before him, all the select stations and points of view, noticed by those authors who have last made the tour of the lakes, verified by his own repeated observations.”</para>
              <para>To this end he included various 'stations' or viewpoints around the lakes, from which tourists would be encouraged to appreciate the views in terms of their aesthetic qualities. Published in 1778 the book was a major success.</para>
              <para>It will usually include full details relating to accommodation, restaurants, transportation, and activities. Maps of varying detail and historical and cultural information are also often include. Different kinds of guide books exist, focusing on different aspects of travel, from adventure travel to relaxation, or aimed at travelers with different incomes, or focusing on sexual orientation or types of diet. Travel guides can also take the form of travel websites.</para>
              <title ezxhtml:level="3">Travel journals</title>
              <para>Goethe's Italian Journey between September 1786 and May 1788</para>
              <para>A travel journal, also called road journal, is a record made by a traveller, sometimes in diary form, of the traveler's experiences, written during the course of the journey and later edited for publication. This is a long-established literary format; an early example is the writing of Pausanias (2nd century AD) who produced his Description of Greece based on his own observations. James Boswell published his The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides in 1786 and Goethe published his Italian Journey, based on diaries, in 1816. A more recent example is Che Guevara's The Motorcycle Diaries. A travelogue is a film, book written up from a travel diary, or illustrated talk describing the experiences of and places visited by traveller.</para>
              <title ezxhtml:level="3">Fiction</title>
              <para>Some fictional travel stories are related to travel literature. Although it may be desirable in some contexts to distinguish fictional from non-fictional works, such distinctions have proved notoriously difficult to make in practice, as in the famous instance of the travel writings of Marco Polo or John Mandeville. An example of a fictional work of travel literature based on an actual journey, is Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, which has its origin in an actual voyage made by Conrad up the River Congo. A contemporary example of a real life journey transformed into a work of fiction is travel writer Kira Salak's novel, The White Mary, which takes place in Papua New Guinea and the Congo. Jack Kerouac's On the Road (1957) and The Dharma Bums (1958) are fictionalized accounts of his travels across the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s.</para>

              <para>New York – often called New York City or the City of New York to distinguish it from the State of New York, of which it is a part – is the most populous city in the United States and the center of the New York metropolitan area, the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United States and one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment. Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world.</para>
              <para>Situated on one of the world's largest natural harbors, New York City consists of five boroughs, each of which is a county of New York State. The five boroughs – Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, the Bronx, and Staten Island – were consolidated into a single city in 1898. With a census-estimated 2014 population of 8,491,079 distributed over a land area of just 305 square miles (790 km2), New York is the most densely populated major city in the United States. As many as 800 languages are spoken in New York, making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world.</para>
              <para>New York City traces its roots to its 1624 founding as a trading post by colonists of the Dutch Republic and was named New Amsterdam in 1626. The city and its surroundings came under English control in 1664. New York served as the capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790. It has been the country's largest city since 1790. The Statue of Liberty greeted millions of immigrants as they came to America by ship in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and is a globally recognized symbol of the United States and its democracy.</para>
              <para>Many districts and landmarks in New York City have become well known, and the city received a record 56 million tourists in 2014, hosting three of the world's ten most visited tourist attractions in 2013. Several sources have ranked New York the most photographed city in the world. Times Square, iconified as "The Crossroads of the World", is the brightly illuminated hub of the Broadway Theater District, one of the world's busiest pedestrian intersections, and a major center of the world's entertainment industry. The names of many of the city's bridges, skyscrapers, and parks are known around the world. Anchored by Wall Street in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan, New York City has been called both the most economically powerful city and the leading financial center of the world, and the city is home to the world's two largest stock exchanges by total market capitalization, the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ.</para>
              <title ezxhtml:level="3">The Silicon Alley</title>
              <para>Silicon Alley, once centered around the Flatiron District, is now metonymous for New York's high tech sector, which has since expanded beyond the area. It has evolved into a metonym for the sphere encompassing the New York City metropolitan region's high technology industries involving the Internet, new media, telecommunications, digital media, software development, biotechnology, game design, financial technology ("fintech"), and other fields within information technology that are supported by its entrepreneurship ecosystem and venture capital investments. In the first half of 2015, Silicon Alley generated over US$3.7 billion in venture capital investment across a broad spectrum of high technology enterprises, most based in Manhattan, with others in Brooklyn, Queens, and elsewhere in the region. High technology startup companies and employment are growing in New York City and the region, bolstered by the city's position in North America as the leading Internet hub and telecommunications center, including its vicinity to several transatlantic fiber optic trunk lines, New York's intellectual capital, and its extensive outdoor wireless connectivity.</para>

              <para>Valencia, officially València, is the capital of the autonomous community of Valencia and the third largest city in Spain after Madrid and Barcelona. Valencia is Spain's third largest metropolitan area, with a population ranging from 1.7 to 2.5 million. The Port of Valencia is the fifth busiest container port in Europe and the busiest container port on the Mediterranean Sea.</para>
              <para>The city is situated on the banks of the Turia, on the east coast of the Iberian Peninsula, fronting the Gulf of Valencia on the Mediterranean Sea. Its historic center is one of the largest in Spain, with approximately 169 hectares; this heritage of ancient monuments, views and cultural attractions makes Valencia one of the country's most popular tourist destinations.</para>
              <para>
                <emphasis role="strong">Origin of the name</emphasis>
              </para>
              <para>The original Latin name of the city was Valentia, meaning ‘strength’, or ‘valor’, the city being named according to the Roman practice of recognizing the valor of former Roman soldiers after a war. The Roman historian Livy explains that the founding of Valentia in the 2nd century BC was due to the settling of the Roman soldiers who fought against an Iberian rebel, Viriatus. During the rule of the Muslim kingdoms in Spain, it had the nickname Medina bu-Tarab ('City of Joy') according to a transliteration, or Medina at-Turab ('City of Sands') according to another, since it was located on the banks of the River Turia. It is not clear if the term Balansiyya was reserved for the entire Taifa of Valencia or also designated the city. Now, by gradual sound changes, Valentia has become Valencia.</para>
              <title ezxhtml:level="2">History</title>
              <para>Valencia is one of the oldest cities in Spain, founded in the Roman period, c. 138 BC, under the name ‘Valentia Edetanorum’ by the consul Decimus Junius Brutus Callaicus. A few centuries later, with the power vacuum left by the demise of the Roman imperial administration, the church assumed the reins of power in the city, coinciding with the first waves of the invading Germanic peoples. The city later surrendered to the invading Moors (Berbers and Arabs) about 714 AD. The Muslims occupied the city, introducing their language, religion, and customs.</para>
              <para>In 1238, King James I of Aragon, with an army composed of Aragonese, Catalans, Navarrese and crusaders from the Order of Calatrava, reconquered the city and divided the land among the nobles who helped him conquer it, as witnessed in the Llibre del Repartiment. The city endured serious troubles in the mid-14th century, including the decimation of the population by the Black Death of 1348 and subsequent years of epidemics — as well as a series of wars and riots that followed.</para>

              </ezembed>
              <para>The 15th century was a time of economic expansion, known as the Valencian Golden Age, in which culture and the arts flourished. Some of the most emblematic buildings of the city were built during this period, including the Serrans Towers (1392), the Silk Exchange (1482), the Micalet and the Chapel of the Kings of the Convent of Sant Domènec. Following the discovery of the Americas, the Valencians, were prohibited participation in the Cross-Atlantic commerce, and with this loss of trade, Valencia eventually suffered an economic crisis. The crisis deepened during the 17th century with the expulsion in 1609 of the Jews and the Moriscos, descendants of the Muslim population that had converted to Christianity.</para>

              <para>The Valencian economy recovered during the 18th century with the rising manufacture of woven silk and ceramic tiles. The 19th century began with Spain embroiled in wars with France, Portugal, and England—but the War of Independence most affected the Valencian territories and the capital city.</para>
              <para>During the second half of the 19th century, the bourgeoisie encouraged the development of the city and its environs; land-owners were enriched by the introduction of the orange crop and the expansion of vineyards and other crops. This economic boom corresponded with a revival of local traditions and of the Valencian language.</para>
              <title ezxhtml:level="2">Things to do</title>
              <para>Starting in the mid-1990s, Valencia, formerly an industrial center, saw a rapid development that expanded its cultural and touristic possibilities and transformed it into a newly vibrant city. Many local landmarks were restored, including the ancient Towers of the medieval city (Serrans Towers and Quart Towers), and the Sant Miquel dels Reis monastery. Whole sections of the old city, for example, the Carmen Quarter, have been extensively renovated.</para>
              <para>In its long history, Valencia has acquired many local traditions and festivals, among them the Falles - a local festival held in March, and La Tomatina - an annual tomato fight, draws crowds to the nearby town of Buñol in August. There are also a number of well-preserved traditional Catholic festivities throughout the year. Holy Week celebrations in Valencia are considered some of the most colorful in Spain.</para>

              <para>The Falles is a traditional celebration held in commemoration of Saint Joseph in the city of Valencia, Spain. The term Falles refers to both the celebration and the monuments burnt during the celebration. Each neighborhood of the city has an organized group of people, the Casal Faller, produces a construction known as a Falla which is eventually burnt. Neighborhood groups vie with each other to make the most impressive and outrageous creations. Their intricate assemblages, placed on top of pedestals for better visibility, depict famous personalities and topical subjects of the past year, presenting humorous and often satirical commentary on them.</para>

              <para>The five days and nights of Falles might be described as a continuous street party. There is a multitude of processions: historical, religious, and comedic. Crowds in the restaurants spill out into the streets. Explosions can be heard all day long and sporadically through the night. The Mascletà, an explosive barrage of coordinated firecracker and fireworks displays, takes place at 2:00 pm every day of the festival. On the final night of Falles, around midnight on March 19, these falles are burnt as huge bonfires. This is known as La Cremà (the Burning), the climax of the whole event, and the reason why the constructions are called falles ("torches").</para>

              <para>Valencia has buildings dating to Roman and Arabic times. The Cathedral, built between the 13th and 15th centuries, is primarily of Gothic style but contains elements of Baroque and Romanesque architecture. Beside the Cathedral is the Gothic Basilica of the Virgin (Basílica De La Mare de Déu dels Desamparats). The 15th-century Serrans and Quart towers are part of what was once the wall surrounding the city.</para>
              <para>UNESCO has recognized the Silk Exchange market (La Llotja de la Seda), erected in early Valencian Gothic style, as a World Heritage Site. The modernist Central Market (Mercat Central) is one of the largest in Europe.</para>

              <para><emphasis role="strong">Kochi </emphasis>(formerly Cochin) also known as the Queen of the Arabian Sea, is a major port city situated on the south-west coast of Indian peninsula by the Arabian Sea and the Laccadive Sea in the state of Kerala. It was an important spice trading center on the west coast of India from the 14th century onward, and maintained a trade network with Arab merchants from the pre-Islamic era. Occupied by the Portuguese in 1503, Kochi was the first of the European colonies in colonial India. It remained the main seat of Portuguese India until 1530, when Goa was chosen instead. The city was later occupied by the Dutch and the British, with the Kingdom of Cochin becoming a princely state. These invasions have left an unforgettable mark on the history and development of Kochi.</para>

              <para>Kochi is the second largest city in Kerala after Thiruvananthapuram and the second largest urban agglomeration in Kerala after Calicut. Kochi ranks first in the total number of international and domestic tourist arrivals in Kerala. Kochi has also been ranked the sixth best tourist destination in India according to a survey conducted by the Nielsen Company on behalf of the Outlook Traveler magazine.</para>
              <para>Kochi is also the home to Southern Naval Command of the Indian Navy and the state headquarters of the Indian Coast Guard with an attached air squadron, named Air Squadron 747.</para>
              <title ezxhtml:level="2">History</title>
              <para>Kochi was the center of Indian spice trade for many centuries. Kochi rose to significance as a trading center after the Port Muziris around Kodungallur (Cranganore) was destroyed by massive flooding of Periyar in 1341. The earliest documented references to Kochi occur in books written by Chinese voyager Ma Huan during his visit to Kochi in the 15th century. There are also references to Kochi in accounts written by Italian traveller Niccolò Da Conti, who visited Kochi in 1440.</para>
              <para>According to many historians, the precursor state to Kingdom of Kochi came into existence in early <emphasis role="strong">12th century</emphasis>, after the fall of the Chera Kingdom. The reign of the Kingdom was hereditary, and the family that ruled over the region was known as the Perumpadappu Swaroopam in the local vernacular.</para>

              <para>Portuguese navigator, Pedro Álvares Cabral founded the first European settlement in India at Kochi in <emphasis role="strong">1500</emphasis>. From <emphasis role="strong">1503 to 1663</emphasis>, Fort Kochi (Fort Emmanuel) was ruled by Portugal. The Portuguese rule was followed by that of the Dutch who renamed Fort Immanuel as Fort Stormsburg. In meantime, the Royal Family of Kochi relocated the capital of Kochi Kingdom to Thrissur, leaving nominal authority over Islands of Kochi. <emphasis role="strong">By 1773</emphasis>, the Mysore ruler Hyder Ali extended his conquest in the Malabar region to Kochi forcing it to become a tributary of Mysore.</para>
              <para>Meanwhile, the Dutch, fearing an outbreak of war on the United Provinces, signed the <emphasis role="strong">Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814</emphasis> with the United Kingdom, under which Kochi was ceded to the United Kingdom in exchange for the island of Bangka. In 1866, Fort Kochi became a municipality, and its first Municipal Council seating contest was conducted in <emphasis role="strong">1883</emphasis>. By <emphasis role="strong">1870s</emphasis>, the capital of Kochi Kingdom was relocated again to Kochi Suburb of Tripunithura. In <emphasis role="strong">1910</emphasis>, Ernakulum became the administrative capital of Kochi Kingdom with establishment of Royal Secretariat and State Durbar. The Offices of Diwan and High court were soon moved into Ernakulum. In <emphasis role="strong">1925</emphasis>, Kochi legislative assembly was constituted due to public pressure on the state.</para>
              <para>In <emphasis role="strong">1947</emphasis>, when India gained independence from the British colonial rule, Cochin was the first princely state to join the Indian Union willingly.</para>
              <para>The city's economic growth gathered momentum after economic reforms in India introduced by the central government in the early-1990s. Since 2000, the service sector has energized the city's economy. The establishment of several industrial parks based on IT and other port based infrastructure triggered a construction and realty boom in the city. Over the years, Kochi has witnessed rapid commercialization, and has today grown into the commercial hub of Kerala</para>

                <emphasis role="strong">Origin of the Name</emphasis>
              </title>
              <para>Ancient travelers and tradesmen referred to Kochi in their writings, variously alluding to it as <emphasis>Cocym</emphasis>, <emphasis>Cochym</emphasis>, <emphasis>Cochin</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Kochi</emphasis>. The origin of the name "Kochi" is thought to be from the Malayalam word <emphasis>kochu azhi</emphasis>, meaning 'small lagoon'. Yet another theory is that Kochi is derived from the word <emphasis>Kaci</emphasis>, meaning ‘harbor’. Accounts by Italian explorers Nicolo Conti (15th century), and Fra Paoline in the 17th century say that it was called <emphasis>Kochchi</emphasis>, named after the river connecting the backwaters to the sea. After the arrival of the Portuguese, and later the British, the name Cochin stuck as the official appellation. The city reverted to a closer Anglicization of its original Malayalam name, Kochi, in 1996.</para>
              <title ezxhtml:level="2">Things to do</title>
              <para>Tourism is one of the strongest drivers of the local economy. Ernakulam district, in which Kochi is situated, ranks first in the total number of domestic tourists visiting Kerala and thus contributes to the economy of the city. The tourist enclave at Fort Kochi and presence of several historical monuments, museums etc. as well as natural attractions like the Vembanad lake and the backwaters attract a large number of tourists to the city. The Kochi Port is one of the leading ports where international cruisers call on regularly. The city has the first marina facility in the country Kochi Marina which attracts yacht-totters. To further tap the potential of the all-season harbor at Kochi, an international cruise terminal, and several marinas are being constructed.</para>
              <para><emphasis role="strong">Chinese Fishing Nets</emphasis> are unique to Kochi and it was earlier thought that the nets might have been introduced by the Chinese explorer Zheng He but the recent research shows that these were introduced by Portuguese Casado settlers from Macau. The Chinese fishing nets have become a very popular tourist attraction, their size, and elegant construction is photogenic and the slow rhythm of their operation is quite hypnotic. In addition, catches can be purchased individually and need be taken only a short distance to a street entrepreneur who will cook it.</para>

              <para>Founded by Bartholomew Columbus in 1496, on the east bank of the Ozama River and then moved by Nicolás de Ovando in 1502 to the west bank of the river, the city is the oldest continuously inhabited European settlement in the Americas, and was the first seat of the Spanish colonial rule in the New World. Santo Domingo is the site of the first university, cathedral, castle, monastery, and fortress in the New World. The city's Colonial Zone was declared as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Santo Domingo was called Ciudad Trujillo, from 1936 to 1961, after the Dominican Republic's dictator, Rafael Trujillo, named the capital after himself. Following his assassination, the city resumed its original designation.</para>

              <para>Dating from 1496, when the Spanish settled on the island, and officially from 5 August 1498, Santo Domingo became the oldest European city in the Americas. Bartholomew Columbus founded the settlement and named it La Nueva Isabela, after an earlier settlement in the north named after the Queen of Spain Isabella I. In 1495 it was renamed "Santo Domingo", in honor of Saint Dominic. Santo Domingo came to be known as the "Gateway to the Caribbean" and the chief town in Hispaniola from then on. Expeditions which led to Ponce de León's colonization of Puerto Rico, Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar's colonization of Cuba, Hernando Cortes' conquest of Mexico, and Vasco Núñez de Balboa's sighting of the Pacific Ocean were all launched from Santo Domingo.</para>
              <para>In June 1502, Santo Domingo was destroyed by a major hurricane, and the new Governor Nicolás de Ovando had it rebuilt on a different site on the other side of the Ozama River. The original layout of the city and a large portion of its defensive wall can still be appreciated today throughout the Colonial Zone, declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.</para>
              <para>In 1586, Francis Drake captured the city and held it for ransom. Drake's invasion signaled the decline of Spanish dominion over Hispaniola. An expedition sent by Oliver Cromwell in 1655 attacked the city of Santo Domingo but was defeated. The English troops withdrew and took the less guarded colony of Jamaica, instead.</para>
              <para>From 1795 to 1822 the city changed hands several times along with the colony it headed. The city was ceded to France in 1795 after years of struggles, it was briefly captured by Haitian rebels in 1801, recovered by France in 1802, and was once again reclaimed by Spain in 1809. In 1821 Santo Domingo became the capital of an independent nation.</para>
              <para>On 27 February 1844, Santo Domingo was again the capital of a free nation when it gained its independence from Haitian occupation, led by Dominican nationalist Juan Pablo Duarte. In 1861 Spain returned to the country, having struck a bargain with Dominican dictator Pedro Santana whereby the latter was granted several honorific titles and privileges, in exchange for annexing the young nation back to Spanish rule. The Dominican Restoration War began in 1863 however, and in 1865 the country was free again after Spain withdrew.</para>
              <para>Over the next two-thirds of a century, Santo Domingo and the Dominican Republic went through many revolutions, power changes, and occupation by the United States, 1916–24. The city was struck by hurricane San Zenón in 1930, which caused major damage. After its rebuilding, Santo Domingo was known officially as Ciudad Trujillo in honor of dictator Rafael Leónidas Trujillo. Following his assassination in 1961, the city was renamed back to Santo Domingo.</para>

              <para><emphasis role="strong">Anchorage</emphasis> is one of the northern-most cities on Earth. Anchorage is located in the south-central portion of Alaska at the terminus of the Cook Inlet on a peninsula formed by the Knik Arm to the north and the Turnagain Arm to the south. The city limits span 1,961.1 square miles (5,079.2 km2) which encompass the urban core, a joint military base, several outlying communities and almost all of Chugach State Park.</para>
              <ezembed xlink:href="ezcontent://[reference:ref_content_image__media__images__places__anchorage__anchorage_on_an_april_evening]" view="embed" ezxhtml:class="ez-embed-type-image" ezxhtml:align="center">

              <para>Its location on the globe puts Anchorage within 9 and 1/2 hours by air to nearly 90% of the industrialized world. For this reason, it is a common refueling stop for many international passenger flights and is home to a major FedEx Hub.</para>
              <title ezxhtml:level="2">History</title>
              <para>Russian presence in south central Alaska was well established in the 19th century. In 1867, U. S. Secretary of State William H. Seward brokered a deal to purchase Alaska from Imperial Russia for $7.2 million (about two cents an acre). His political rivals lampooned the deal as "Seward's folly", "Seward's icebox" and "Walrussia". By 1888, gold was discovered along Turnagain Arm.</para>
              <para>In 1912, Alaska became a United States territory. Anchorage, unlike every other large town in Alaska south of the Brooks Range, was neither a fishing nor a mining camp. The area surrounding Anchorage lacks significant economic metal minerals. While a number of Dena'ina settlements existed along Knik Arm for years, only two white men, Bud Whitney and Jack Brown, were reported to have lived in the Ship Creek valley in the 1910s prior to the large influx of settlers.</para>
              <para>The city grew from its happenstance choice as a site of a railroad construction port for the Alaska Engineering Commission. The construction of the Alaskan Railroad continued until its completion in 1923. The city’s economy in the 1920’s and 1930s centered on the railroad.</para>
              <para>Between the 1930s and 1950s, the city experienced massive growth as air transportation and the military gained importance. In 1968 ARCO discovered oil in Prudhoe Bay on the Alaska North Slope, and the resulting oil boom spurred further growth in Anchorage. In 1975, the City of Anchorage and the Greater Anchorage Area Borough (which includes Eagle River, Girdwood, Glen Alps, and several other communities) merged into the geographically larger Municipality of Anchorage.</para>
              <para>The city continued to grow in the 1980s and since then several attempts have been made to move Alaska's state capital from Juneau to Anchorage - or to a site closer to Anchorage.</para>

              <para>The city is on a strip of coastal lowland and extends up the lower alpine slopes of the Chugach Mountains. Point Campbell, the westernmost point of Anchorage on the mainland, juts out into Cook Inlet near its northern end, at which point it splits into two arms. To the south is Turnagain Arm, a fjord that has some of the world's highest tides. Knik Arm, another tidal inlet, lies to the west and north. The Chugach Mountains on the east form a boundary to development, but not to the city limits, which encompass part of the wild alpine territory of Chugach State Park.</para>

This park is popular with the photographers as it houses diverse wildlife as well as topography. There are more than 45 species of mammals living in this park. The brown bears and moose are so prevalent that you often find them wandering in the streets of Anchorage.</para>
              <para><emphasis role="strong">Anchorage Coastal Wildlife Refuge</emphasis> is located on a 16-mile-long section of coastline in Anchorage, Alaska. The vast majority of the refuge is located on intertidal floodplains of glacial silt, with a smaller portion consisting of coastal wetlands, bogs, wooded areas, and Potter Marsh, a popular wildlife viewing area.</para>

Potter Marsh is open during the winter for ice skating. Despite its proximity to urban Anchorage, public access to much of the refuge is limited to unmarked trails through wooded areas, and the glacial silt floodplains that make up most of the refuge can be dangerous.</para>

              <para>Brooklyn is geographically adjacent to the borough of Queens at the western end of Long Island. Since 1896, Brooklyn has had the same boundaries as Kings County, the most populous county in the State of New York and the second-most densely populated county in the United States, after New York County (Manhattan).</para>
              <para>In the first decades of the 21st century, Brooklyn has experienced a renaissance as an avant-garde destination for hipsters, with concomitant gentrification, dramatic house price increases, and a decrease in housing affordability. Since 2010 it has evolved into a thriving hub of entrepreneurship and high technology startup firms, and of postmodern art and design.</para>
              <title ezxhtml:level="2">History</title>
              <para>The history of European settlement in Brooklyn spans more than 350 years. The settlement began in the 17th century as the small Dutch-founded town of "Breuckelen" on the East River shore of Long Island, grew to be a sizable city in the 19th century, and was consolidated in 1898 with New York City (then confined to Manhattan and part of the Bronx), the remaining rural areas of Kings County, and the largely rural areas of Queens and Staten Island, to form the modern City of New York. Many Brooklyn neighborhoods are ethnic enclaves where particular ethnic and nationality groups and cultures predominate.</para>
              <title ezxhtml:level="3">Colonial Era</title>
              <para>In the Colonial era, The Dutch were the first Europeans to settle Long Island's western edge, which was then largely inhabited by the Lenape, a Native American. The "Breuckelen" settlement, named after Breukelen in the Netherlands, was part of New Netherland. After the final English conquest of New Netherland in 1664, New Netherland was taken in a naval action, and the conquerors renamed their prize in honor of the overall English naval commander, James, Duke of York.</para>

              <para>In 1883, the Brooklyn Bridge was completed, transportation to Manhattan was no longer by water only, and the City of Brooklyn's ties to the City of New York were strengthened. The first half of the 19th century saw the beginning of the development of urban areas on the economically strategic East River shore of Kings County, facing the adolescent City of New York confined to Manhattan Island. The New York Navy Yard operated in Wallabout Bay (border between Brooklyn and Williamsburgh) for the entire 19th century and two-thirds of the 20th century</para>
              <para>Two major institutions were created in the 1860s. First The Brooklyn Eagle, and Kings County Democrat published by Alfred G. Stevens. It later became the most popular and highest circulation afternoon paper in America. Second the borough's soon-to-be-famous National League baseball team, the Brooklyn Dodgers. But both major institutions were lost in the 1950s: the paper closed in 1955 after unsuccessful attempts at a sale following a reporters' strike, and the baseball team decamped for Los Angeles in a realignment of major league baseball in 1957.</para>
              <para>Since the late 20th century, Brooklyn has benefited from a steady influx of financial back office operations from Manhattan, the rapid growth of a high-tech and entertainment economy in DUMBO, and strong growth in support services such as accounting, personnel supply agencies, and computer services firms.</para>

              <para>Amsterdam's name derives from Amstelredamme, indicative of the city's origin as a dam of the river Amstel. Originating as a small fishing village in the late 12th century, Amsterdam became one of the most important ports in the world during the Dutch Golden Age (17th century), a result of its innovative developments in trade. In the 19th and 20th centuries, the city expanded, and many new neighborhoods and suburbs were planned and built. During that time, the city was the leading center for finance and diamonds. In the 19th and 20th centuries, the city expanded, and many new neighborhoods and suburbs were planned and built. The 17th-century canals of Amsterdam and the 19–20th century Defence Line of Amsterdam are on the UNESCO World Heritage List.</para>

              <para>As the commercial capital of the Netherlands and one of the top financial centers in Europe, Amsterdam is considered an alpha world city. The city is also the cultural capital of the Netherlands.</para>
              <title ezxhtml:level="2">History</title>
              <para>Amsterdam's founding is relatively recent compared with much older Dutch cities such as Nijmegen, Rotterdam, and Utrecht. Amsterdam was granted city rights in either 1300 or 1306. From the 14th century on, Amsterdam flourished, largely because of trade with the Hanseatic League.</para>
              <para>In the 16th century, the Dutch rebelled against Philip II of Spain and his successors. The revolt escalated into the Eighty Years' War, which ultimately led to Dutch independence. The Dutch Republic became known for its relative religious tolerance.</para>
              <para>The 17th century is considered Amsterdam's Golden Age, during which it became the wealthiest city in the world. Amsterdam's merchants had the largest share in both the Dutch East India Company and the Dutch West India Company. These companies acquired overseas possessions that later became Dutch colonies. In 1602, the Amsterdam office of the international trading Dutch East India Company became the world's first stock exchange by trading in its own shares. The Bank of Amsterdam started operations in 1609, acting as a full-service bank for Dutch merchant bankers and as a reserve bank.</para>

              <para>The Amsterdam canal system was built in the early 17th century when immigration was at a peak, a comprehensive plan was developed that was based on four concentric half-circles of canals with their ends emerging at the IJ bay. The canals served for defence, water management, and transportation.</para>
              <para>Amsterdam's prosperity declined during the 18th and early 19th centuries. The end of the 19th century is sometimes called Amsterdam's second Golden Age. New museums, a railway station, and the Concertgebouw were built; in this same time, the Industrial Revolution reached the city. The Amsterdam–Rhine Canal was dug to give Amsterdam a direct connection to the Rhine, and the North Sea Canal was dug to give the port a shorter connection to the North Sea. Both projects dramatically improved commerce with the rest of Europe and the world.</para>
              <para>Germany invaded the Netherlands on 10 May 1940 and took control of the country. Some Amsterdam citizens sheltered Jews, thereby exposing themselves and their families to the high risk of being imprisoned or sent to concentration camps. One of the most famous deportee was the young Jewish girl Anne Frank, who died in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.</para>
              <para>Post Second World War, many new suburbs, such as Osdorp, Slotervaart, Slotermeer, and Geuzenveld, were built. These suburbs contained many public parks and wide, open spaces, and the new buildings provided improved housing conditions with larger and brighter rooms, gardens, and balconies.</para>
              <para>In the early years of the twenty-first century, there has been renewed focus on urban regeneration and renewal, especially to areas directly bordering the city center.</para>

              <title ezxhtml:level="2">The Why</title>
              <para>Travel. Food. These are the things that move us. Since we were wee toddlers, our team has been extremely passionate about immersing ourselves in wonderful places and tastes. From the first place we visited to the last taste, we strive to understand and experiences cultures as they are, rather than as we’d like them to be. Though the story of why we came together in pursuit of this magazine is something of lore.</para>
              <para>It was a warm sunny Tuesday morning, our favorite day of course. Before we were a full team, we were all employees at the same company, eZ Systems. We all started at the company at different times, but became the best of friends. Needless to say, most of our conversations revolved around our travels, both to foreign lands and the foreign flavors we’ve had.</para>
              <para>These transient moments of connection are what propel us to explore. We strive to live for these fleeting moments. They are passionate, loving, and curiosity-inducing. It stirs the soul and warms the heart.</para>
              <para>This is what we hoped for Tasteful Planet. We hope to be a source of inspiration for you all and for you to inspire us in return!</para>

              <title ezxhtml:level="2">The How</title>
              <para>As we mentioned earlier, before we created Tasteful Planet, our team were all staff members at a great software company called eZ Systems.</para>
              <para>As passionate as we were about the CMS space, we were a tad bit more interested in exploring the real world. Like other entrepreneurs, we decided to band together and start this blog as a side-project. Initially, our site had close to 40 visitors. Now, 35 of those visits were from our own team, with 5 being from friends and family.</para>
              <para>It’s been quite a journey to see our tiny little magazine scale to now having a mailing list of close to 400,000 readers. We are incredibly humbled to know that our nearly 1.5 million website visitors choose to engage with our magazine out of all the other wonderful travel mags out there.</para>
              <para>Though we’ve scaled quite fast and quite quickly over the past 5 years, have no fear; we won’t lose our core values. Our prime prerogative is to explore, experience, and digest. We live to share these experiences with you all, and in return, are inspired by the amazing journeys that you guys, our readers, take on your own.</para>
              <para>So here’s to the journey, my friends. We’ll see you when we see you.</para>

              <title ezxhtml:level="2">Support Us</title>
              <para>Listen up, y’all. Times are tough. Taking all these beautiful shots on instagram and promoting these posts into your Facebook feeds ain’t cheap. Toss us a few bucks so we can keep our lights on and our photographers paid.</para>
              <para>Okay here’s the long pitch: We need YOUR support in order to keep delivering great content. We’re not like those other magazines out there. We don’t have funding from some huge crazy monolithic publishing organization. We are boot-strapped and entirely self-funded. We run off of donations from you, our incredible audience.</para>
              <para>It would mean a lot to us if you guys appreciate our content enough to support us financially as we explore the world’s tastes and places. Though we can’t offer you Kickstarter-level awards, we CAN give you lots of hugs! (Just shoot us an email when you’re in Brooklyn and we’ll invite you on by to our office for a hug-fest! We promise it won’t be creepy).</para>
              <para>Thanks for your support!</para>
